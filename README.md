# naive-bayes
Naive Bayes is a quick and dirty way to classify data but is simple to implement. 

## Notes

The implementation source code came from this [tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/naive-bayes-classifier-scratch-python/) and credit goes to Dr. Jason Brownlee who wrote it. I adjusted the implementation to fit my needs for the dataset that I wished to clean and classify.
